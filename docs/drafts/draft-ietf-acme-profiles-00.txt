1.  Introduction

   Throughout the history of the WebPKI, Certificate Authorities have
   used "profiles" to describe the kinds of certificates they issue.
   For example, an "S/MIME" profile might indicate that the resulting
   certificate will contain the id-kp-emailProtection Extended Key Usage
   and use a Certificate Policy OID to assert compliance with the CA/
   Browser Forum S/MIME Baseline Requirements; or a "Constrained Sub-CA"
   profile might indicate the inclusion of the Basic Constraints
   extension, the keyCertSign Key Usage, and a Name Constraints
   extension.  Subscribers generally select a profile as part of their
   certificate ordering process or negotiations with the CA, depending
   on their needs (and sometimes their budget).

   The ACME protocol only allows clients to customize their certificate
   in two ways: the newOrder request allows selection of the identifiers
   (generally Subject Alternative Names) and validity period; and the
   finalize request contains a CSR in which the client can theoretically
   include any combination of fields and extensions that they desire.
   But requesting certificate features via the CSR is onerous, error-
   prone, and dangerous.  Numerous compliance incidents across the
   WebPKI have been caused by CAs trusting values included in a CSR and
   copying them directly into the issued certificate.  It requires
   clients to know how to construct a valid CSR, provides no mechanism
   for servers to advertise what CSR fields they're willing to accept,
   and means that CAs have to evaluate on a case-by-case basis which
   combinations of requested features they're willing to issue.

   This document provides a mechanism for ACME Servers to advertise what
   certificate profiles they offer, and for ACME Clients to select a
   profile when creating a new Order.  This allows site operators to
   make informed decisions about the kind of certificate they request,
   without placing an undue burden on ACME Clients or Servers to
   transmit such information in the form of a CSR.  It also encourages
   the evolution of the WebPKI by allowing CAs to more easily offer new
   and improved profiles while maintaining backwards compatibility for
   old subscribers.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Extensions to the Directory Resource

   An ACME Server which wishes to allow Clients to select profiles MUST
   include a new field, profiles, in the meta field of its Directory
   object.

   profiles (optional, object): A map of profile names to human-readable
   descriptions of those profiles.

   The contents of these human-readable descriptions are up to the CA;
   for example, they might be prose descriptions of the properties of
   the profile, or the might be URLs pointing at a documentation site.
   ACME Clients SHOULD present these profile names and descriptions to
   their operator during initial setup and at appropriate times
   thereafter.

       HTTP/1.1 200 OK

           }
         }

4.  Extensions to the Order Resource

   In order to convey information about the profile associated with an
   Order, a new field is added to the Order object:

   profile (string, optional): A string uniquely identifying the profile
   which will be used to affect issuance of the certificate requested by
   this Order.

   To select a profile, the client includes the desired profile name in
   the profile field of the Order object they supply to the newOrder
   request.  The client SHOULD NOT request a profile name that is not
   advertised in the server's Directory metadata object.

       POST /acme/new-order HTTP/1.1
       Host: acme.example.com
       Content-Type: application/jose+json

       {
         "protected": base64url({
           "alg": "ES256",
           "kid": "https://acme.example.com/acct/evOfKhNU60wg",
           "nonce": "5XJ1L3lEkMG7tR6pA00clA",
           "url": "https://acme.example.com/new-order"
         }),
         "payload": base64url({
           "identifiers": [{"type": "dns", "value": "example.org"}],
           "profile": "profile1"
         }),
         "signature": "H6ZXtGjTZyUnPeKn...wEA4TklBdh3e454g"
       }

   If the server receives a newOrder request specifying a profile that
   it is not advertising, or specifying a profile which is incompatible
   with the rest of the contents of the request (e.g. a "tls-server-
   auth" profile alongside an identifier of type "email"), it MUST
   reject the request with a problem document of type "invalidProfile"
   (see Section 6.3).

   If it accepts the request, the server responds with an Order object
   including the selected profile.

         "finalize": "https://acme.example.com/order/TOlocE8rfgo/finalize",
       }

   If the server is advertizing profiles and receives a newOrder request
   which does not identify a specific profile, it is RECOMMENDED that
   the server select a profile and associate it with the new Order
   object.

   If a server receives a request to finalize an Order whose profile the
   CA is no longer willing to issue under, it MUST respond with a
   problem document of type "invalidProfile".  The server SHOULD attempt
   to avoid this situation, e.g. by ensuring that all Orders for a
   profile have expired before it stops issuing under that profile.

5.  Security Considerations

   The extensions to the ACME protocol described in this document build
   upon the Security Considerations and threat model defined in
   Section 10.1 of [RFC8555].  It does not change the account management
   or identifier validation flows, so the security considerations are
   largely unchanged.

   The one exception is in regards to CA Policy Considerations.  RFC
   8555 did not address how a server should determine whether it is
   willing to issue the certificate as requested by the finalize CSR.
   This document greatly simplifies this determination by making the
   contents of the CSR (beyond the Subject Alternative Names and Subject
   Public Key) irrelevant to the decision-making process.

   Additionally, by moving profile selection out of the finalize CSR and
   into the Order resource itself, this document reduces the need for
   ACME Clients and Servers to parse and process x509 ASN.1.  This
   increases the security and stability of the WebPKI as a whole by
   reducing the incidence of parsing errors and the likelihood of values
   being copied directly from the CSR into the resulting certificate.
